In this project I took data from letterboxd and box office mojo. I cleaned, transformed and analyzed the data via SQL. I did further analysis via excel. Then I created visualizations via PowerBI(free version).
THe intially raw data can be found in the Letterboxd_Raw_Data folder.
Queries used can be found in the Movie_SQL_Queries folder.
For further explanation for what was accomplished with each SQL file, look in the Project Notes Word Doc.
A lot of the transformed data can be found in the Movie_Data excel file. 
Many of the querie results that I ended up doing more with were saved on Movie_Project_Query_Results.
Most of my visualizations, analysis and findings can be found in the Movie_Project_Summary Word Doc.
